# 🧠 TutorBuddy: Agentic Mastery Platform

**TutorBuddy** is a world-class, agentic tutoring application designed to empower learners aged 5-17. By leveraging the full suite of Google’s latest generative models, it transforms simple queries into a complete **Mastery Canvas**—comprising structured lessons, cinematic AI videos, and adaptive quizzes.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Mastery Canvas
Every session generates a comprehensive learning dashboard:
- **Expert Tutorials**: Structured Markdown lessons generated by **Gemini 3 Flash**, featuring subject-specific terminology and age-appropriate analogies.
- **AI Visualizer**: A 10-second high-fidelity educational video powered by **Veo 3.1**.
- **Image Loop Fallback**: An efficient 3-part educational slideshow powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** (Nano Banana) for environments where video is disabled.
- **Adaptive Quiz**: A 5-question mastery check to validate learning immediately.

### 2. Safety-First Architecture
TutorBuddy is built with the highest guardrails for child safety:
- **AI Pre-Check**: Every user query is analyzed by a safety classifier before generation. Topics involving partisan politics, adult themes, or controversial social issues are gracefully blocked.
- **Safety Directives**: All generative prompts are hardened with strict neutrality and child-safety system instructions.

### 3. Subject-Specific Context
The platform provides specialized tutoring across five core academic disciplines:
- **Math**: Logic-heavy, formula-focused explanations.
- **Science**: Evidence-based, consensus-driven scientific tutorials.
- **Latin**: Philological insights and translation-focused content.
- **English**: Literature and grammar-optimized tutorials.
- **Geography**: Cartographic and cultural context-rich lessons.

### 4. Personalization & Export
- **Age Calibration**: Vocabulary and concept complexity automatically scale from primary school (Age 5) to advanced high school (Age 17).
- **Export Tools**: Lessons can be downloaded as Markdown (.md) files, and AI videos can be saved as MP4s for offline study.
