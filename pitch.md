## 🚀 The Problem
*   **One-size-fits-all education** fails diverse learners.
*   **Private tutoring** is prohibitively expensive ($50+/hr).
*   **Static content** (textbooks/PDFs) lacks engagement and emotional connection.
*   **Parental disconnection**: Guardians often don't know what their child is learning or how to help.

## 💡 The Solution: TutorBuddy
TutorBuddy is an **Agentic AI Tutor** that empowers students aged 5–17. It transforms a simple topic request into a comprehensive, multi-modal **Mastery Canvas** instantly. It doesn't just "output text"—it orchestrates a complete educational experience.

### ✨ Key Differentiators (The "Wow" Factors)

1.  **Agentic Orchestration (Gemini 3 Flash)**
    *   Instead of a simple chat, TutorBuddy acts as an agent that plans a curriculum. It validates safety, researches the topic using **Google Search Grounding**, and structures a pedagogical lesson plan in real-time.
    *   *Feature*: **Contextual OCR**. Students can snap a photo of their homework, and TutorBuddy aligns its lesson with their specific school curriculum.

2.  **Hyper-Personalized Multi-Modality**
    *   **Visual Learners**: Receive 5 custom AI-generated diagrams and illustrations (Gemini 2.5 Image).
    *   **Auditory Learners**: Listen to an emotional, multi-speaker podcast-style dialogue between "Buddy" (the tutor) and "Sam" (the curious student) using **Gemini 2.5 Native Audio**.
    *   **Kinesthetic/Active Learners**: Interactive SVGs and "Deep Dive" micro-lessons that allow exploring tangents instantly.

3.  **Guardian Insights Loop**
    *   While the child learns, TutorBuddy acts as a consultant for the parent.
    *   Generates a dedicated **Parent Report** summarizing what was learned, highlighting cognitive wins, and suggesting offline activities to reinforce learning.

4.  **Safety-First Architecture**
    *   Built-in "Pre-Check" agent that screens topics for age-appropriateness and safety before generation begins.
